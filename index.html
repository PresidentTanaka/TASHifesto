<!-- INTRO -->

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in">Who are you? That's a question man has tried to answer for ages, and
we finally have the answer. You're a hustler, an entrepreneur, a
product. It is the natural state of man. We are all products, small
start-ups with our potential not realized yet. We must sell
ourselves, construct our essence to be marketable, and hustle to the
top. A dedicated Tanakist will have no issue with this, and will
become an apostle of the Market. But, there's  a parasite, a vampire
stealing your potential. The G-Man, The System, Spooks... Taxes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/> </p>

<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->

<p align="center"><b>1. THE TANAKIST REVOLUTION.</b></p>
<p class="break"><br/> </p>
<p>	Tanakism began one, simple morning. I was selling Tanaka Energy, my own
personal brand, and the G-Man came up and busted me for not having a
licence! Even worse, I was fined, taxed! What gives the right for
some coddled, weak agent with a stapler fetish the right to interfere
with my grind? My right to be a Hustler? That's when I had an
epiphany! An idea! A product, you could say. Have you ever wanted to
be rich? Ever considered investing in stock! Well boy do I have an
investment opportunity for you! <i>...Tanakism</i><span style="font-style: normal">!</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>
</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 2 -->

<p align="center"><b>2. GOD. THE MARKET.</b></p> 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>	Let's face it. A good portion of Gensokyo are slobs, they sit around all
day, do nothing, well, they probably only take a shower every three
days! You probably feel like you're missing something, hmm? Religion,
right? It's a good idea in concept, but, think about all that
charity... Luckily for you reading this, there's a new god in town...
The Market! It's a god that sanctifies the Hustlers and punishes the
Lazy, with its invisible, majestic hand, it self regulates itself
with precise efficiency! Sadly, those bureaucrat vampires try to
interfere with its gospel with the greatest sin in the world...
Taxes!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 3 -->

<p align="center"><b>3. TAXES ARE RACIST.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Those failures in the government have come up with the ultimate way to keep
us content with failure. Taxes. They justify it with 'labour costs',
'welfare', 'fairness', blergh! I'm sick of it all. We as humans were
made to be Hustlers, we were meant to spend money at the dance floor!
But those vampires suck up all of our potential and give it to the
Lazy, expecting us to be content with that! Even worse, it keeps
<i>minorities</i> down! Taxes, a fake form of 'compassion' are meant
to limit your potential, to keep you lower than the bureaucrats!
Instead of giving them the opportunity of hustling, you make them
content with lousy welfare! Taxes are racist I tell you, racist! Real
racial consciousness is setting the brothers free with Tanakism!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 4 -->

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>4. ...NOT A TANAKIST ALREADY?</p></b>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">What are you, a racist? Don't be a racist! Be a cool ultraliberal free
market advocate! You'll just keep feeding off of the states rotting
corpse until there's nothing else to feast on. The Tanakist Way is
the greatest way for the future. It is the deepest wish of the
authors that Tanakism can save this declining country, and create the
ultimate form of society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 5 -->

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>5. YOUR ONLY MOVE IS HUSTLE.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Alright, taxes are gone, welfare is gone. Where does that leave you? Well
bucko, you've been left with a promising business, yourself! In the
world of Tanakism, every man is a product to be sold... In a good
way, of course! You have to hustle your way to the top of the ladder,
really stick to the grind. During this step, it's good to remember:</p>
<h2 align="center"><i><u><b>THE 5 CORE TENETS OF TANAKISM</b></u></i></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><u><b>1.</b>
Money is Everything!</u></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><u><b>2.</b>
Everything is Money!</u></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><u><b>3.</b>
Your Money is Nobody Else's!</u></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><u><b>4.</b>
Everybody's Money is Yours!</u></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><u><b>5.Never Don't Make Money!</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>	Following these 5 steps is how you hustle. If you don't follow this, you're no
better than the proles! Keep things street. Every person you talk to
is another Hustler, and you have to hustle them until you're the
number #1 hustler, bravo! In a Tanakist society, that is your only
move.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 6 -->

<p align="center"><b>6. THE IDEAL HUSTLER.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>	Well, you've hustled your way to the top! You're practically unstoppable.
What's left: getting in on the disco! Partying, dancing, champagne,
all the glitz and the glamour you'll ever desire! These are the
traits that compose the Tanakist lifestyle! You'll keep being an
awesomepossum superduperliberal free market advocate until you die!
For you've won your way to the heaven of Tanakism, where every man is
an equal hustler.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 7 -->

<p align="center"><b>7. TANAKIST HEAVEN.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>	In Tanakist Heaven, every man, woman, and child is a hustler, dancing on
the larger disco floor of life... Your eternal goal in life is to
stay in the green, while letting everyone else fall to the red.
Charity? Slobishness? Pencil-pushers taking your, what WOULD have
been successful, business away?! No longer will that be an issue.
Why? Because the Market regulates itself. And, if you work hard
enough, you can be a Hustler too!</p>
